<h1>Python Spreadsheet Analysis Final Project - For Code First Girls </h1>

<p>
This Python project aims to analyze sales and expenditure data from a spreadsheet for the year 2018. The analysis includes calculating total sales and expenditure, finding monthly changes as percentages, determining the highest and lowest sales and expenditure values, and calculating average sales and expenditure.

  <li> Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.</li>
  <li> Run the analysis.py script using the following command:</li>

```
python analysis.py
```
<li>The script will read the data, perform the analysis, and display the results.</li>
</ol>

## Results
After running the script, you will see the following results:

<li> Total sales and expenditure for the year 2018.</li>
<li> Monthly changes in sales and expenditure as percentages.</li>
