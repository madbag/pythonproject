#Python Spreadsheet Analysis for Code First Girls
This Python project aims to analyze sales and expenditure data from a spreadsheet for the year 2018. The analysis includes calculating total sales and expenditure, finding monthly changes as percentages, determining the highest and lowest sales and expenditure values, and calculating average sales and expenditure.

Project Structure
analysis.py: This Python script reads data from the sales.csv spreadsheet, performs various analyses, and displays the results.

sales.csv: This CSV file contains sales and expenditure data for each month of the year 2018.

Usage
To run the analysis, follow these steps:

Ensure Python is installed on your system.

Place the analysis.py script and the sales.csv file in the same directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.

Run the analysis.py script using the following command:

Copy code
python analysis.py
The script will read the data, perform the analysis, and display the results.

Results
After running the script, you will see the following results:

Total sales and expenditure for the year 2018.
Monthly changes in sales and expenditure as percentages.
The highest and lowest sales and expenditure values.
Average sales and expenditure.
Dependencies
This project relies on Python 3.x and the standard csv module, which comes bundled with Python.
